        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. I cook the scallops
                 a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and they're still 
                 tender and moist. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from 
                 the longer cook time.</p>
