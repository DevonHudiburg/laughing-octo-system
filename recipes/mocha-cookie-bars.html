        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These chocolaty cookie bars are somewhat of a cross between a brownie and a cookie,
                 with a flavor reminiscent of Mexican hot chocolate. They're best if you err on the
                 side of under- versus over-baking.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder</li>
               <li>1 tablespoon strong brewed coffee</li> 
               <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li> 
               <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li> 
               <li>1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar</li> 
               <li>1/2 teaspoon bakind soda</li> 
               <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> 
               <li>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon</li> 
               <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li> 
               <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li> 
               <li>1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li> 
               <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li> 
               <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li> 
            </ul>
            <h3>Topping</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan
                 with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li> 
                <li>Stir espresso powder and coffee together in a small bowl until espresso powder
                 is completely dissolved.</li> 
                <li>Whisk flour, cocoa, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon
                 cinnamon together in a bowl; set aside.</li> 
                <li>Beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer
                 together until light and fluffy in a bowl. Beat in espresso mixture, egg, and
                 vanilla until well combined. Stir in flour mixture; mix until a dough just begins
                 to form. Press dough firmly and evenly into the prepared pan using lightly floured hands.</li> 
                <li>Whisk 1 tablespoon white sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a
                 small bowl; sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over the dough.</li> 
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the dough in the center of the pan feels barely
                 set, 20 to 23 minutes.</li> 
                <li>Allow cookies to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Use the overhanging parchment to lift
                 cookies out to a wire rack; cool completely before cutting into bars.</li> 
            </ol>
